# Branch Protection Test

## Purpose
This file is created to test that branch protection rules are working correctly.

## Test Scenario
1. Create this test file on feature branch
2. Push to trigger GitHub Actions workflows
3. Create PR to main branch
4. Verify that status checks appear and must pass
5. Confirm merge is blocked until all checks pass

## Expected Behavior
- âœ… Feature Branch CI workflows should run
- âœ… All status checks should appear in PR
- âœ… Merge should be blocked until checks pass
- âœ… Review requirements should be enforced

## Test Status
- **Created**: January 5, 2025
- **Branch**: feature/github-actions-setup
- **Purpose**: Verify branch protection functionality

## Success Criteria
Branch protection is working correctly if:
1. PR shows required status checks
2. Merge button is disabled until checks pass
3. All configured workflows run successfully
4. Review requirements are enforced

This test confirms our GitHub Actions and branch protection setup is production-ready! ðŸš€
