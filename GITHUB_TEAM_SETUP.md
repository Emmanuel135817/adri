# GitHub Team Setup - Final Steps

## 🏷️ Team to Create

**Team Name**: `maintainers`

## 📋 GitHub Team Setup Steps

### 1. Create the Team
1. Go to: **Settings** → **Manage access** → **Teams** → **"New team"**
2. **Fill out:**
   - **Team name**: `maintainers`
   - **Description**: `Core maintainers of the ADRI project`
   - **Visibility**: **Public** (recommended for open source)
   - **Parent team**: Leave blank
3. **Add yourself** as the only member initially
4. Click **"Create team"**

### 2. Verify Team Configuration
After creation, the team will be accessible as:
- **GitHub reference**: `@adri-standard/maintainers`
- **URL**: `https://github.com/orgs/adri-standard/teams/maintainers`

### 3. Test CODEOWNERS Integration
Once the team is created:
- CODEOWNERS file will automatically assign you as reviewer for all PRs
- You'll get notifications for all pull requests
- GitHub will show "Review required from @adri-standard/maintainers"

## ✅ What's Already Configured

- ✅ **CODEOWNERS** - Simplified to use single team
- ✅ **Branch Protection** - All rules configured with status checks
- ✅ **GitHub Actions** - Smart tiered enforcement workflows
- ✅ **Issue Templates** - Complete set with linking guidance
- ✅ **PR Template** - Comprehensive validation checklist
- ✅ **Documentation** - Growth-optimized guides

## 🧪 Ready for Testing

After you create the `maintainers` team, we can test:

1. **High-risk change** (core module) - Should require full workflow
2. **Low-risk change** (documentation) - Should be friendly and flexible
3. **Violation scenarios** - Should provide helpful guidance

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

**For Core Changes** (`adri/core/`, `adri/decorators/`, etc.):
- ❗ **Issue link required** (will block if missing)
- ❗ **Proper branch naming required** (will block if incorrect)
- ❗ **Review required** from @adri-standard/maintainers
- ❗ **All status checks must pass**

**For Documentation** (`docs/`, `README.md`, etc.):
- 💡 **Issue link suggested** (helpful tip, won't block)
- 💡 **Branch naming suggested** (guidance, won't block)  
- ✅ **Review required** from @adri-standard/maintainers
- ✅ **Status checks must pass**

This gives us the perfect balance of quality protection and growth enablement!
