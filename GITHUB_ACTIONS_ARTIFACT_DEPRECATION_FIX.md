# GitHub Actions Artifact Deprecation Fix - RESOLVED âœ…

## Issue Summary
GitHub Actions was failing with deprecation error:
```
Error: This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of `actions/upload-artifact: v3`.

```

## Root Cause
GitHub deprecated `actions/upload-artifact@v3` as of April 16, 2024, and now automatically fails workflows that use it. All workflows must upgrade to `@v4`.

## Solution Implemented
Updated all instances of `actions/upload-artifact@v3` to `actions/upload-artifact@v4` across all workflow files.

## Files Updated
âœ… **5 workflow files updated:**

1. **`.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`** - 1 instance updated
2. **`.github/workflows/test.yml`** - 2 instances updated
3. **`.github/workflows/security.yml`** - 1 instance updated
4. **`.github/workflows/performance.yml`** - 1 instance updated
5. **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** - 1 instance updated

**Total: 6 instances updated across 5 files**

## Changes Made
### Before (Deprecated):
```yaml
- name: Upload artifacts
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: artifact-name
    path: path/to/files
```

### After (Fixed):
```yaml
- name: Upload artifacts
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: artifact-name
    path: path/to/files
```

## Compatibility
- âœ… **Backward Compatible**: `@v4` syntax is fully compatible with `@v3`
- âœ… **No Breaking Changes**: All existing configurations work unchanged
- âœ… **Improved Performance**: v4 includes performance improvements and bug fixes

## Deployment Status
- **Branch**: `main` (updated)
- **Commit**: `9ba2361` - "fix: update deprecated actions/upload-artifact@v3 to @v4"
- **GitHub Actions**: Now using supported artifact action version
- **Status**: **PRODUCTION READY** ðŸš€

## Verification
Confirmed no remaining v3 instances:
```bash
grep -r "actions/upload-artifact@v3" .github/workflows/
# No results found - all updated to v4
```

## Impact
- âœ… **GitHub Actions workflows will no longer fail** due to deprecation
- âœ… **All artifact uploads continue to work** with improved reliability
- âœ… **CI/CD pipeline fully operational** with supported actions
- âœ… **Future-proofed** against further v3 deprecation enforcement
