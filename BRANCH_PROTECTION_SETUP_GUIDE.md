# Branch Protection Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide provides the exact status check names and configuration for setting up branch protection rules after our GitHub Actions workflows are running.

## Current Workflow Status Checks

Based on our workflow analysis, here are the **exact status check names** that will appear in GitHub:

### Main Branch CI Workflow (`test.yml`)
- **Workflow Name**: `Main Branch CI`
- **Job Names**:
  - `quality-gate`
  - `test (3.10)`
  - `test (3.11)`
  - `test (3.12)`
  - `performance`
  - `build-validation`
  - `summary`

### Feature Branch CI Workflow (`feature-ci.yml`)
- **Workflow Name**: `Feature Branch CI`
- **Job Names**:
  - `test (3.10)`
  - `test (3.11)`
  - `test (3.12)`
  - `security-scan`
  - `pr-comment`

### Conventional Commits Workflow (`conventional-commits.yml`)
- **Workflow Name**: `Conventional Commits`
- **Job Names**:
  - `conventional-commits`

## Branch Protection Configuration

### Step 1: Access Branch Protection Settings
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Branches**
3. Find your branch protection rules for `main` and `production`

### Step 2: Required Status Checks for Main Branch

**Essential Status Checks** (Minimum Required):
```
Main Branch CI / quality-gate
Main Branch CI / test (3.11)
Main Branch CI / build-validation
Conventional Commits / conventional-commits
```

**Comprehensive Status Checks** (Recommended):
```
Main Branch CI / quality-gate
Main Branch CI / test (3.10)
Main Branch CI / test (3.11)
Main Branch CI / test (3.12)
Main Branch CI / performance
Main Branch CI / build-validation
Conventional Commits / conventional-commits
```

### Step 3: Required Status Checks for Production Branch

**Production Branch Status Checks**:
```
Main Branch CI / quality-gate
Main Branch CI / test (3.10)
Main Branch CI / test (3.11)
Main Branch CI / test (3.12)
Main Branch CI / performance
Main Branch CI / build-validation
Conventional Commits / conventional-commits
```

### Step 4: Additional Protection Settings

**Recommended Settings for Both Branches**:
- ‚úÖ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- ‚úÖ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
- ‚úÖ **Require pull request reviews before merging** (1 reviewer minimum)
- ‚úÖ **Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed**
- ‚úÖ **Require review from code owners** (if CODEOWNERS file exists)
- ‚úÖ **Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100 MB**
- ‚úÖ **Require signed commits** (optional, for enhanced security)

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Wait for Workflows to Run
1. **Trigger workflows** by pushing to your feature branch or creating a PR
2. **Wait for completion** - all workflows must run at least once
3. **Verify success** - ensure our coverage fix resolved the issues

### Phase 2: Configure Branch Protection
1. **Navigate to Settings** ‚Üí **Branches** in GitHub
2. **Edit main branch rule**:
   - Add required status checks from the list above
   - Enable "Require branches to be up to date"
   - Set minimum reviewers (recommend 1)
3. **Edit production branch rule**:
   - Add all status checks (more comprehensive)
   - Require 2 reviewers for production
   - Enable all security features

### Phase 3: Test Protection Rules
1. **Create a test PR** to main branch
2. **Verify status checks** appear and must pass
3. **Test merge blocking** - ensure failed checks block merge
4. **Confirm review requirements** work as expected

## Status Check Descriptions

| Status Check | Purpose | Critical |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| `quality-gate` | Code formatting, linting, type checking, security | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `test (3.11)` | Core test suite with 90% coverage | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `test (3.10/3.12)` | Multi-Python compatibility | ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommended |
| `performance` | Performance benchmarks | ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommended |
| `build-validation` | Package building and validation | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `conventional-commits` | Commit message format validation | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `security-scan` | Security vulnerability scanning | ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommended |

## Troubleshooting

### Status Checks Not Appearing
- **Cause**: Workflows haven't run yet
- **Solution**: Push a commit or create a PR to trigger workflows

### Wrong Status Check Names
- **Cause**: Workflow or job names changed
- **Solution**: Check the actual workflow run in GitHub Actions tab

### Protection Too Strict
- **Cause**: Too many required checks causing delays
- **Solution**: Start with essential checks, add more gradually

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ **Workflows Fixed**: Coverage issue resolved
- ‚úÖ **Workflows Defined**: All necessary CI/CD pipelines in place
- üîÑ **Next Step**: Configure branch protection with above status checks
- ‚è≥ **Pending**: Workflow runs to populate status check list

## Quick Setup Commands

Once workflows have run, use these exact status check names in GitHub:

**Minimum Protection (Fast Setup)**:
```
Main Branch CI / quality-gate
Main Branch CI / test (3.11)
Main Branch CI / build-validation
Conventional Commits / conventional-commits
```

**Full Protection (Comprehensive)**:
```
Main Branch CI / quality-gate
Main Branch CI / test (3.10)
Main Branch CI / test (3.11)
Main Branch CI / test (3.12)
Main Branch CI / performance
Main Branch CI / build-validation
Conventional Commits / conventional-commits
Feature Branch CI / security-scan
