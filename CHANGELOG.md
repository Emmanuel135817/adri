Subject: [PATCH 2/3] Fix CI Essential workflow test paths

- Update pyproject.toml testpaths to point to development/testing/tests
- Update CI Essential workflow to run core unit tests instead of examples/demos
- Replace incorrect test commands with development/testing/tests/unit/ execution
- Resolves systematic CI failures blocking PR merges

This fixes the core issue where CI Essential was running example/demo tests
instead of comprehensive core unit tests, causing false CI failures.
