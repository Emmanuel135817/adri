## 🚀 What is ADRI?

ADRI is a comprehensive data reliability framework designed specifically for AI agents and data-driven applications. It provides automated assessment, validation, and protection for your data workflows.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🛡️ **Data Protection Decorator**

- **Consistency**: Internal data coherence
- **Plausibility**: Realistic value ranges

### 🔧 **CLI Tools**
```bash
# Assess your data
adri assess data.csv

# Generate standards
adri generate-standard data.csv

# Validate against standards
adri validate data.csv --standard my_standard.yaml
```
