# Issue-Driven Development Implementation Plan

## [Overview]
Implement comprehensive issue-driven development workflow to enhance community transparency and ensure all features have proper tracking from conception to deployment.

The ADRI project currently has strong technical governance (branch protection, automated testing, conventional commits) but lacks issue-to-feature traceability. This implementation establishes a clear workflow where all development work originates from GitHub issues, enabling community visibility into feature decisions, progress tracking, and development rationale. This approach will help contributors understand the development process and encourage community participation.

## [Types]
No new type definitions required for this governance workflow implementation.

This is primarily a process automation and documentation enhancement effort focused on GitHub repository governance and contributor workflow management.

## [Files]
Comprehensive GitHub repository configuration and documentation updates to support issue-driven development.

**New files to be created:**
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md` - Template for new feature requests
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/enhancement.md` - Template for improvements to existing features
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/discussion.md` - Template for general project discussions
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` - Issue template configuration
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` - Template requiring issue links and validation
- `.github/workflows/validate-pr-issue-link.yml` - Automation to check PR-issue connections
- `.github/workflows/branch-naming-validation.yml` - Enforce branch naming conventions
- `docs/CONTRIBUTOR_DOCS/ISSUE_DRIVEN_WORKFLOW.md` - Complete workflow documentation

**Files to be modified:**
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Add issue-first workflow section and branch naming conventions
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/data_quality_bug.md` - Add issue linking guidance
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/langchain_integration.md` - Add issue linking guidance
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/crewai_integration.md` - Add issue linking guidance  
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/autogen_integration.md` - Add issue linking guidance

**Repository settings to configure:**
- Branch protection rules to require linked issues
- Auto-labeling based on issue types
- PR auto-assignment based on issue assignees

## [Functions]
No function modifications required for this repository governance implementation.

This implementation focuses on GitHub automation workflows and repository configuration rather than code changes to the ADRI framework itself.

## [Classes]
No class modifications required for this repository governance implementation.

The workflow implementation uses GitHub Actions and repository configuration rather than modifying ADRI's core classes.

## [Dependencies]
No new code dependencies required for this governance workflow.

GitHub Actions and repository settings provide all necessary automation capabilities. The implementation relies on existing GitHub features and marketplace actions.

## [Testing]
Comprehensive testing approach for the new governance workflow.

**Workflow Testing:**
- Test issue template rendering and field validation
- Verify PR template appears correctly with required fields
- Test GitHub Actions trigger correctly on PR creation/updates
- Validate branch naming enforcement works as expected
- Test auto-labeling functionality

**Integration Testing:**
- Create test issues using new templates
- Create test PRs with proper issue links
- Test workflow with branch naming violations
- Verify automation handles edge cases correctly

**Documentation Testing:**
- Validate all links in updated documentation work correctly
- Test workflow instructions are clear and complete
- Ensure examples in documentation are accurate

## [Implementation Order]
Execute changes in logical sequence to ensure smooth workflow transition.

1. **Create Issue Templates**
   - Add feature_request.md template with comprehensive sections
   - Add enhancement.md template for existing feature improvements
   - Add discussion.md template for general project discussions
   - Create config.yml to organize template selection
   - Test template rendering in GitHub interface

2. **Create PR Template**
   - Add PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md requiring issue references
   - Include sections for issue link, testing checklist, documentation updates
   - Add automated checks and reviewer guidance
   - Test template appears correctly on PR creation

3. **Implement GitHub Actions Automation**
   - Create validate-pr-issue-link.yml workflow
   - Add branch-naming-validation.yml for naming conventions
   - Configure auto-labeling based on issue types
   - Test workflows trigger correctly and provide useful feedback

4. **Update Existing Issue Templates**
   - Add issue linking guidance to all existing templates
   - Ensure consistency across all issue types
   - Update template formatting for better usability

5. **Update Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive ISSUE_DRIVEN_WORKFLOW.md guide
   - Update CONTRIBUTING.md with issue-first workflow
   - Add branch naming conventions documentation
   - Include examples and best practices

6. **Configure Repository Settings**
   - Update branch protection rules
   - Configure issue and PR auto-assignment
   - Set up project boards if needed
   - Configure notification settings

7. **Retroactive Implementation & Testing**
   - Create issue for completed simplification work
   - Link existing PR as example implementation
   - Document the retroactive process
   - Test full workflow end-to-end

8. **Community Communication**
   - Announce new workflow in discussions
   - Update project documentation
   - Provide migration guide for existing contributors
   - Create onboarding materials for new contributors
