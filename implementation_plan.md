# Implementation Plan

## [Overview]
Strategic CI pipeline optimization to resolve critical deployment failures while maintaining enterprise-grade quality standards and creating a manageable development workflow.

The current CI pipeline has 17 different workflows creating complexity that's blocking PR completion. The root cause is a missing `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in the repository root (currently located in `development/config/`), version inconsistencies between tools, and overly complex workflow dependencies. This plan implements a tiered CI approach with fast feedback loops, consolidated workflows, and maintains quality without the pain.

The strategy focuses on immediate critical fixes followed by systematic optimization to create a sustainable, high-quality CI process that accelerates rather than blocks development.

## [Types]
Workflow configuration types and CI pipeline structure definitions.

```yaml
# Core CI Configuration Types
WorkflowTier:
  - essential: "Quality gates that must pass for merge"
  - extended: "Additional validations for specific scenarios" 
  - release: "Production deployment and publishing workflows"

QualityGate:
  - fast_feedback: "< 2 minutes - formatting, linting, basic tests"
  - comprehensive: "< 10 minutes - full test suite, security scans"
  - performance: "< 15 minutes - benchmarks and integration tests"

# Configuration Consolidation Types  
ConfigurationProfile:
  tool_versions:
    black: "25.1.0"
    isort: "5.12.0" 
    flake8: ">=6.0"
    mypy: ">=1.0"
  python_versions: ["3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
  quality_thresholds:
    coverage: 90
    performance_degradation: 5%
```
