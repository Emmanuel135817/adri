# Implementation Plan: Fix GitHub Actions Failures

## [Overview]
Fix failing GitHub Actions workflows in the ADRI validator project by resolving benchmark test skipping, dependency conflicts, and import issues that prevent proper CI/CD execution.

The project has comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows for testing, performance benchmarking, and releases, but they're currently failing due to benchmark tests being skipped and missing dependencies. This implementation addresses all root causes systematically.

## [Types]
Fix benchmark test execution and dependency management.

**Key type definitions and configurations:**
- Benchmark test markers and configuration in pytest.ini
- Performance test data structures and fixtures  
- Missing import dependencies in test modules
- Package dependency version constraints in pyproject.toml
- Environment variable configurations for CI/CD

## [Files]
Modify existing files to resolve import and configuration issues.

**Specific file modifications:**
- `tests/test_benchmarks.py`: Fix import issues and test configuration
- `pyproject.toml`: Add missing performance testing dependencies
- `pytest.ini`: Update test markers and timeout configuration  
- `adri/analysis/data_profiler.py`: Create missing DataProfiler class
- `adri/analysis/standard_generator.py`: Create missing StandardGenerator class
- `.github/workflows/test.yml`: Update workflow dependencies
- `.github/workflows/performance.yml`: Fix script execution issues
- `scripts/compare_benchmarks.py`: Fix missing import handling

## [Functions]
Create missing classes and fix existing import functionality.

**New functions:**
- `DataProfiler.profile_data(data)`: Profile dataset and return summary statistics
- `StandardGenerator.generate_standard(profile, name, config)`: Generate data standards from profile
- Benchmark fixture functions for test data generation
- Performance measurement utility functions

**Modified functions:**  
- Update import statements in benchmark tests
- Fix package dependency resolution in workflows
- Update script error handling for missing dependencies

## [Classes]
Create missing classes referenced in benchmark tests.

**New classes:**
- `DataProfiler`: Analyze data structure and generate profiles
- `StandardGenerator`: Generate ADRI standards from data profiles  

**Modified classes:**
- `AssessmentEngine`: Already exists, ensure proper integration
- Update test fixture classes for better performance test data

## [Dependencies]
Add missing performance testing dependencies and resolve version conflicts.

**New dependencies:**
```toml
memory-profiler>=0.60.0  # For memory usage benchmarks
psutil>=5.9.0           # For system resource monitoring  
numpy>=1.24.0           # For test data generation (already present)
```

**Version constraint fixes:**
- Update pydantic version constraint to resolve conflicts
- Ensure tabulate is available for benchmark reporting (already added)

## [Testing]
Ensure all benchmark tests execute properly and performance workflows succeed.

**Test execution requirements:**
- All 10 benchmark tests must pass (currently skipping)
- Performance thresholds must be properly checked
- Memory usage tests must execute without errors
- Benchmark comparison scripts must handle missing previous results

**Validation steps:**
1. Local pytest execution with benchmark markers
2. Performance workflow execution in GitHub Actions
3. Benchmark result artifact generation and comparison

## [Implementation Order]
Sequential implementation to minimize conflicts and ensure successful integration.

**Step-by-step implementation:**

1. **Create missing analysis classes** (`DataProfiler`, `StandardGenerator`)
2. **Fix benchmark test imports** and remove skipping conditions  
3. **Update dependencies** in pyproject.toml for performance testing
4. **Fix pytest configuration** for proper benchmark test execution
5. **Update GitHub Actions workflows** to handle missing artifacts gracefully
6. **Test local benchmark execution** to verify fixes
7. **Update benchmark comparison scripts** for better error handling
8. **Validate CI/CD pipeline** with test commits
9. **Update documentation** for performance testing setup
10. **Monitor first successful workflow run** and adjust thresholds if needed
