# Implementation Plan

## Overview
Systematically resolve the 5 open pull requests starting with the oldest (PR #17) to establish a working PR process and enable successful merges while addressing underlying CI/quality gate issues.

The goal is to resolve each PR individually, starting with PR #17 (GitHub Pages deployment fix), to understand and fix the systematic issues preventing PR merges. This approach will establish a reliable PR process by identifying and resolving the root causes of CI failures, ensuring future PRs can be successfully processed. The systematic nature of failures across all PRs suggests common configuration or validation issues that need to be addressed at the infrastructure level.

## Types
No new type definitions required for this investigation and resolution task.

This task focuses on resolving existing PR blocking issues rather than implementing new features. The work involves debugging CI failures, fixing configuration issues, and validating that the PR process works correctly. No data structures, interfaces, or type changes are needed since we're working with existing GitHub workflow configurations and repository settings.

## Files
Systematic file analysis and modification across CI configurations and repository settings.

**Files to be analyzed:**
- `.github/workflows/conventional-commits.yml` - conventional commits validation workflow
- `.github/workflows/ci-essential.yml` - main CI pipeline causing quality gate failures
- `.github/workflows/pages.yml` - Jekyll build and deployment workflow
- `development/config/.commitlintrc.json` - commit message validation rules
- `docs/_config.yml` - Jekyll configuration for Pages deployment
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - pre-commit hook configurations
- `pyproject.toml` - Python project configuration affecting CI

**Files likely requiring modification:**
- `development/config/.commitlintrc.json` - may need commit lint rule adjustments
- `.github/workflows/conventional-commits.yml` - may need workflow fixes
- `.github/workflows/ci-essential.yml` - likely needs pre-commit and quality gate fixes
- `docs/_config.yml` - may need repository configuration updates
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - may need hook configuration fixes

**New files to potentially create:**
- `.commitlintrc.json` (root level) - if conventional commits workflow expects it at root
- CI debugging scripts for troubleshooting workflow failures

## Functions
No new functions required, focus on debugging and fixing existing workflow functions.

**Existing workflow functions to debug:**
- Conventional commit validation logic in `conventional-commits.yml`
- Pre-commit hook execution in CI Essential pipeline
- Jekyll build process in Pages workflow
- Quality gate aggregation in CI Essential Complete job

**Functions to potentially modify:**
- Commit message validation logic to handle PR-specific commit patterns
- Pre-commit hook execution to resolve configuration conflicts
- Error reporting and logging in CI workflows for better debugging

## Classes
No new classes required for this investigation and resolution task.

This work involves configuration debugging and workflow fixes rather than code implementation. The focus is on GitHub Actions workflow configurations, commit validation rules, and CI pipeline settings rather than application code changes.

## Dependencies
Investigation and potential modification of CI/CD tool dependencies.

**Current dependencies to analyze:**
- `@commitlint/cli` and `@commitlint/config-conventional` (Node.js packages for commit validation)
- `pre-commit` framework and associated hooks
- Jekyll and Ruby dependencies for documentation site
- Python testing and linting tools in the CI pipeline

**Potential dependency updates:**
- Update commitlint packages if version compatibility issues exist
- Review pre-commit hook versions and configurations
- Verify Jekyll/Ruby gem versions for Pages compatibility
- Check Python tool versions in CI environment

## Testing
Systematic testing approach for each PR resolution step.

**Testing strategy:**
- Validate CI fixes by running workflows locally where possible
- Test commit message formats against the conventional commits rules
- Verify Jekyll builds work locally before pushing changes
- Run pre-commit hooks locally to identify configuration issues
- Use GitHub Actions workflow testing with draft PRs

**PR #17 specific testing:**
- Test Jekyll build with repository configuration changes
- Validate that Pages deployment workflow succeeds
- Verify conventional commit format for PR #17 commits
- Test pre-commit hooks pass with PR #17 changes

## Implementation Order
Sequential PR resolution starting with oldest to establish working process.

**Step 1: Analyze PR #17 failures**
- Examine specific CI failure logs for conventional commits workflow
- Identify exact commit message validation failures
- Review Jekyll build errors in test-build job
- Analyze pre-commit hook failures in Quality Gate job

**Step 2: Fix PR #17 blocking issues**
- Resolve conventional commits failures (likely commit message format issues)
- Fix Jekyll build configuration problems
- Address pre-commit hook configuration conflicts
- Update any missing repository settings

**Step 3: Validate PR #17 fixes**
- Push fixes and verify CI pipeline success
- Test complete workflow from commit to merge
- Ensure all required checks pass
- Document successful resolution approach

**Step 4: Apply lessons learned to remaining PRs**
- Use PR #17 resolution pattern for PRs #18-#21
- Address any PR-specific issues that differ from common patterns
- Establish documentation for future PR troubleshooting

**Step 5: Document process improvements**
- Create troubleshooting guide for common CI failures
- Update contributor documentation with resolved issues
- Establish monitoring for CI pipeline health
